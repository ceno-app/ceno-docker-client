# A ready-to-run client for the Ceno network

See <https://censorship.no/>.

A Ceno client has three main roles:

 1. Allowing a user to retrieve potentially censored content from injectors or other users.
 2. Sharing retrieved content with other users (seeding).
 3. Allowing other users to reach injectors (bridging).

## Building (developers only)

Build for the latest version of Ouinet with:

    $ sudo docker build -t equalitie/ceno-client .

Build for Ouinet version `vX.Y.Z` as `latest` with:

    $ sudo docker build --build-arg OUINET_VERSION=vX.Y.Z -t equalitie/ceno-client:vX.Y.Z -t equalitie/ceno-client:latest .

## Running the client

On a GNU/Linux system, run the client for the first time with:

    $ sudo docker run --name ceno-client -dv ceno:/var/opt/ouinet --network host --restart unless-stopped equalitie/ceno-client

This will start the client automatically along with the system.

**Note:** If your system is not GNU/Linux (e.g. Windows, macOS), you will need to setup some port redirections as the client can not have direct access to the host's network stack. Replace `--network host` with `-p 127.0.0.1:8077-8078:8077-8078 -p 28729:28729/udp` in the previous command line.

Watch the client's output with:

    $ sudo docker logs -ft ceno-client

Subsequently, start/stop the client manually with:

    $ sudo docker start ceno-client
    $ sudo docker stop ceno-client

### Debug logging

By default, debug messages from the client are off. If you want to turn them on temporarily (until the client is stopped), go to <http://localhost:8078/> and change "Log level" in there. To enable debugging permanently, run:

    $ sudo docker exec ceno-client sed -i 's/^#log-level /log-level /' /var/opt/ouinet/client/ouinet-client.conf

And restart the client.

### Avoiding client download issues

If the `docker run` command above fails while *pulling* because `docker.io` servers are unreachable or they forbid you from downloading from them, here is one workaround. In a system which has access to the `docker.io` servers, run:

    $ sudo docker pull equalitie/ceno-client
    $ sudo docker image save equalitie/ceno-client:latest | gzip > ceno-client.tgz

Then transfer `ceno-client.tgz` to your system and run:

    $ gzip -dc ceno-client.tgz | sudo docker load

Then you can try the `docker run` command again.

## Upgrading the client

You first need to get the latest version of the client, and then remove the existing one:

    $ sudo docker pull equalitie/ceno-client
    $ sudo docker stop ceno-client
    $ sudo docker rm ceno-client

There is no danger of losing existing client data, as it is kept in its own volume.

Finally, run the client again with `docker run` as indicated in the previous section.

## Using the client as a bridge

A bridge client is nothing but a normal client (that can be run by anyone) which happens to:

  - Be able to reach injectors. This means that the ISP used by the device running the client is not blocking access to those particular Internet hosts.
  - Be reachable to other clients. As the device where the client runs may not have a public IP address, but its router may, the client tries to use UPnP to automatically set up the appropriate port redirections at the router; otherwise manual redirections can be set up by a user with admin access to the router.

Please note that many mobile connections (and some domestic ones) use CGNAT which makes the client unreachable from the outside, thus making them unfit for bridges.

**Note:** If your system is not GNU/Linux (e.g. Windows, macOS), you will need to manually setup a redirection to UDP port 28729 of the device running the client.

## Publishing a static cache

If your computer stores a Ouinet static cache root directory `/path/to/my-static-cache` (containing a `.ouinet` hidden directory and maybe other data files), with content signed by Ceno injectors, you can configure your client to seed it. When executing `docker run`, add the following arguments right before `equalitie/ceno-client`:

    -v /path/to/my-static-cache:/var/opt/ouinet-static-cache:ro

Your client will start seeding as soon as it starts. Please note that you need to stop and remove the `ceno-client` container if it already exists.

## Testing the client with a browser

**Warning:** Browsing via a Ceno client on a computer is only supported for testing. Please use [Ceno Browser](https://censorship.no) for a better experience on Android.

  1. Clone the Ceno Web Extension repo: `git clone https://github.com/censorship-no/ceno-ext-settings.git`
  2. Create a test profile for Firefox: `mkdir ceno-test`
  3. Run Firefox with the test profile: `firefox --no-remote --profile ceno-test`
  4. Go to <http://localhost:8078/> and install the client-specific CA certificate linked in there to identify web sites.
  5. Enable the Ceno Extension: in Firefox's *Add-ons* window, click on the gears icon, then *Debug Add-ons*, then *Load Temporary Add-onâ€¦* and choose the *manifest.json* file under the `ceno-ext-settings` directory.
  6. Since Ceno Browser v1.3.0 and newer uses HTTPS for all pages, enable *HTTPS-Only Mode* in Firefox's *Settings* window, under *Privacy & Security*. For older browsers lacking that option, install the [HTTPS by default][] extension instead.

**Note:** If you have an old Ceno Extension (less than v1.4.0, click on *Manifest URL* to check its `version` close to the beginning), you also need to set `localhost` port `8077` as Firefox's proxy for protocols HTTP and HTTPS/SSL: <https://www.wikihow.com/Enter-Proxy-Settings-in-Firefox>

In subsequent test browser runs you will only need to follow steps 3 and 5.

Browse freely or check the [Ceno User Manual][ceno-man-test] for some testing instructions.
